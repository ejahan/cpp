Time to create a horde of Zombies!

Implement the following function in the appropriate file:

Zombie* zombieHorde( int N, std::string name );

It must allocate N Zombie objects in a single allocation. Then, it has to 
initialize the zombies, giving each one of them the name passed as parameter.

The function returns a pointer to the first zombie.

Implement your own tests to ensure your zombieHorde() function works as expected.

Try to call announce() for each one of the zombies.

Don t forget to delete all the zombies and check for memory leaks.
